I remember the first time I encountered this issue: in Steve McConnell’s excellent book Rapid Development, which I remember reading in 1997. (Wow! I should read it again.) He referred to “gold-plating” as one of his Classic Development Mistakes. You might immediately think, Uh… stop it!, but until then I hadn’t realised just how pervasively programmers in particular tended to do this. They would continue working on something, even though they’d solved the underlying problem. This sounded utterly insane to me. Suddenly, I saw it everywhere. I noticed when others did it. (They loved that.) I noticed when I did it. I didn’t really understand why.
When I started practising test-first programming (and later test-driven development), this problem slowly disappeared—at least for a while. (Read on; you’ll see why.) For years, one of my IBM office mates challenged me to justify writing the tests first. He argued that as long as he wrote his tests and production code in tiny cycles, it didn’t much matter which he wrote first. For years, I never had a good answer for him. Of course, now that I do, I have no idea where to find him.
